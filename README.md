# To-Do List

This is a simple and intuitive to-do list application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. It helps in managing daily activities effectively. I created this project to learn more about React.js, how it works, and how to manage state efficiently in a dynamic web application.

## Features
- Add new tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks from the list
- Save tasks to local storage, so data persists even after page reloads

## What I Learned from This Project
- **Component-based architecture**: Dividing the UI into reusable components
- **State management with `useState`**: Managing and updating task states like adding and removing tasks
- **Data persistence with `useEffect`**: Using the `useEffect` hook to store and retrieve tasks from local storage, ensuring tasks are saved even after reloading the page
- **Event handling**: Handling user inputs and events like clicks for adding, editing, and deleting tasks
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Efficient styling for responsive design and component-based styling

## Technologies Used
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (frontend tool for fast development setup)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (utility-first CSS framework for styling)
